The amount of data that is produced in the past decade is much greater than the total of the data produced before that from the time of invention of the computer or the internet. Each day, trillions of terabytes of data is being produced and consumed. And in the online retail reviews, or even our particular case of interest i.e. online movie reviews sentiment analysis. There are so many ways that a reviewers can give a feedback about a movie. And each reviewer based on his interests give different kinds of feedbacks which can be positive, negative, neural, and sometimes extreme.  Itâ€™s very hard for someone to monitor such comments, and also it is of importance to know the talk of the each movie for better analytics. And manually performing this task is extremely tedious, and time consuming. Our project focuses on automating this aspect, by performing the sentiment analysis on the movie reviews data so we classify each review as positive, negative, neutral.   We can use this project in various aspects, either as just how it is to know the nature of the review, or this could be a sub module for building the a recommendation system, or personality analyzer.
